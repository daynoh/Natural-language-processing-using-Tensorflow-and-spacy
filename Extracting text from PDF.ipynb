Launch sector\\n-speci\\nfic flagship projects in agro\\n-processing, textiles, leather construction \\nservices and \\nmaterials,\\n oil, gas and mining services and IT related sector that build on our \\ncomparative advantage. Good examples include the National Optical Fibre Backbone \\ninfrastru\\ncture, Analogue to Digital Tv broadcasting migration, Fertilizer cost reduction \\nproject and Petroleum, mining and Energy Bill 2014\\n 2. Develop Kenyan small and medium \\nenterprises (\\nSMEs) by supporting rising stars and \\nbuilding capabilities with model \\nfactories.\\n The\\n government has formulated strategies to \\nquicken the process of starting a business in favour of small firms. It has addressed SMEs \\nchallenges by enforcing \\nlegislation on local content for public projects establishing ‚buy \\nKenya, build Kenya™ policies \\nin public \\nprocurement, research\\n and development\\n 3. Create and enable environment to accelerate industrial development through industrial \\nparks along infrastructure corridors, technical \\nskills,\\n supporting incubators for \\nknowledge\\n-based\\n growth\\n-oriented\\n enterpri\\nses that will have a potential to grow medium \\nlevel sizes within fairly short periods\\n 4. Create an industrial development \\nfund (\\nIDF). The core principles of the funds work \\ninclude; having no favourite industry, helping strong players, empowering innovators, \\nopenness and one\\n-stop approach. The IDF programmes \\ninclude; development projects, \\nleasing projects, consortium projects and establishment of mass production of tools and \\nmachinery. The aim is to invest in industrial skills for future economy.\\n '"
